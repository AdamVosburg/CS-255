CS-255 System Analysis and Design

The DriverPass project focused on designing an integrated driver education system blending online and in-person instruction for a startup seeking to modernize novice driver training. As the client, DriverPass wanted to develop an engaging eLearning platform with interactive modules for rules-of-the-road mastery combined with behind-the-wheel coaching to develop real on-road confidence and decision-making skills.

A major strength demonstrated was interpreting the client's vision and needs into comprehensive functional and non-functional requirements within the business requirements document. Explicitly mapping user stories to features and then tying them to specific solution capabilities laid the groundwork for strategic design decisions later. I also believe the system design leveraged UML modeling effectively across several diagrams to showcase workflow orchestration, sequence elaborations, and key data classes.

If choosing an area needing improvement, I would enhance capturing more granular technical specifications related to the cloud infrastructure, security protocols, and performance benchmarks required to scale access over multi-year horizons. While high-level needs were documented and tying to user goals is prudent, low-level operational details regarding target service levels for system attributes directly impact product quality and long-term total cost of ownership.
Thoroughly incorporating comprehensive user, functional, and technical requirements ensures designs match genuine needs and desired outcomes. Without this alignment, even the most elegant solutions will likely miss the mark resulting in cost/time overruns to retroactively course correct. Prioritizing this insight instills appropriate context before diving into creation.

When tasked with new system analysis/design projects, I plan to establish a consistent structure following protest phases - gathering wide-ranging requirements, comparatively evaluating alternatives, formally documenting recommended design elements then validating with consumer feedback before full-scale development. This systems thinking approach helps set complete optimization targets spanning needs, capabilities, and attributes.
